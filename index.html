				Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, 
                anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist

                He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in Porbandar,
                 a town in Gujarat in western India on 2 October 1869.
				<br><br>
				Gandhi studies law in London. While there he meets playwright George Bernard Shaw 
                and social reformer Annie Besant, among other notable figures.
                He is introduced to the Bible and to the Bhagavadgita,
                which he reads for the first time in its English translation by Sir Edwin Arnold..<br><br>
				In 1906 a discriminatory law is passed in the Transvaal region of South Africa forcing all Indians
                 to register with the provincial government or else face punishment.
                Under Gandhi's leadership the Indian community takes a pledge to defy the law
                and to suffer all the penalties resulting from its defiance.
                 This practice becomes known as satyagraha, <br><br>
				☛ In 1919 Gandhi becomes a leader in the Indian National Congress political party.
                 He campaigns for swaraj, or “self-rule.” 
                He works to reconcile all classes and religious sects, especially Hindus and Muslims.<br><br> 
                ☛ Gandhi leads tens of thousands of Indians on a 240-mile (385-kilometer) march to the sea to 
                collect their own salt. The march is a protest against a British tax on salt and results in 60,000 people
                being arrested. In 1931 the British viceroy and Gandhi sign an agreement
                (the Gandhi-Irwin Pact) marking the end of a period of civil disobedience in India against British rule. T
				<br><br>
                <strong>
					“Father Of Nation”</strong>
				<br><br> ☛ Under a new viceroy, Gandhi is imprisoned again. While in prison he fasts to protest
                 the British decision to segregate the so-called untouchables (the lowest level of the Indian caste system) 
                 by allotting them separate electorates in the new constitution.
                 The fast causes an emotional upheaval in the country, and the British agree to change the policy.
				<br><br> ☛ Gandhi, who in 1934 had resigned as leader and member of the Indian National Congress, becomes politically active again early in World War II, demanding immediate independence as India’s
                 price for aiding Britain in the war. He is imprisoned again, from 1942 to 1944.
				<br><br> ☛ ndia formally achieves independence from British rule. However, the partition of the
                 subcontinent into India and Pakistan is a great disappointment to Gandhi, who has long worked for
                 Hindu-Muslim unity. Rioting between Muslims and Hindus over the partition breaks out in many areas
				<br><br> ☛ While on his way to prayer in Delhi, Gandhi is killed by a young Hindu fanatic who has been 
                angered by Gandhi’s efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims.
